# Trade Simulation System

The simulation system is software to help humans simulate and test trading methods out against different data sets. The system achieves this by running bots through a genetic algorithm over many generations to see what the best configuration for a trading system is given the configuration of genes and data sets. In addition, using the best bots from the simulation, the human user should be able to simulate the bot against the dataset and others to do a further analysis of it's effectiveness.

The system is not meant to find the best trading algorithm for the given data set. Instead it acts as a tool to help the user find a trading algorithm they can use to provide liquidity in markets. It's the combination of human ingenuity and the incredible ability of computers to simulate an extraordinary amount of scenarios that will lead to desirable results.

# Genetic Algorithm - Long Term Vision

In biology, we have discovered the human body to be infinitely more complex then we initially imagined. The human body is affected by a wide range of attributes, ranging from the gut microbiome, nutrient, the environment, thoughts, desires, genes etc.

In genetics alone, we have discovered gene expression is much more complex then we initially thought.  Genes effect other genes which affect biological processes. Genes can be expressed more or less based on environmental stresses to the body and perhaps even human thought can affect the expression of genes as thought can affect the hormones in our system.

One of the long term goals of this project is to have the system configurable in a way that represents the genes of a bot more closely to human biology. While the project will initially express genes as traditionally thought of (gene effects x by the same amount always), ultimately the project will try and replicate the more complex side of genetics. Many genes affecting a wide range of systems and behaviors and work more on a scale instead of a binary system (Gene is this so do this to gene is this much expressed affecting and nudging x behavior/system by some amount).

## Breakdown of data

While the genetic algorithm will provide the bots most fit for trading, the human user will need to use the results of the simulation to refine the system. An important aspect of the simulation system is for the user to be able to interact with a single bot and it's genes and modify the data set of various genes in ways to see changes in outcome.

The program will do it's best to provide useful information to the user so they can make better decisions. the program should be thought of as a playground for human curiosity to discover interesting and unique trading systems.
